# chess_ai
This is a demo project intended to blossom into a chess AI. My goal is to not only make a formittable AI, but also to show how it thinks. This way, we can better understand why an AI plays the moves it does and perhaps gain a better understanding of the game of chess.

Currently, there is only a game board where users can enter moves and play chess (with the exception of being able to promote pawns).
