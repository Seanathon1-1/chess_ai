# Chess AI

This is an ongoing chess AI project designed to play standard chess against a human player. In it's current iteration, it includes a basic engine capable of evaluating positions, generating legal moves, and selecting optimal moves using a minimax algorithm.

## Features

- **Move Generation**: Generates all possible legal moves for a given position.
- **Evaluation Function**: Evaluates the board position to assess which player has the advantage.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: Searches the game tree to find the best move.
