# chess_ai
This is a demo project intended to blossom into a chess AI. My goal is to not only make a formittable AI, but also to show how it thinks. This way, we can better understand why an AI plays the moves it does and perhaps gain a better understanding of the game of chess.

Currently, there is only a game board where users can enter moves and play chess. Moves should be entered as the concatenation of the starting and destination squares using algebraic notation (ie 1.e4 would be entered as e2e4).
